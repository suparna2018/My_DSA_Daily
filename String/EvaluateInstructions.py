'''Parse + validate strings for a simple language as follows :
1. str -> "add(1,3)"
2. str -> "sub(1,3)"
3. str -> "mult()"
* operations take only 2 params. commands may be nested.
4. ie. add(sub(3,4), 1) sub(add(238943, 2343), add(1, sub(323, 43)))
* if an error is detected, report the column and what the error was

Question somewhat like this
Execute result of -> Sum(4, Minus((3,Multiply(7,8)))'''



def Evaluate(s):
    pass
